Save with name `Point`\n3. `Point.new(10, 20)` -> Create object with x=10, y=20\n4. Access data with `.x` or `.y`\n\nWritten in normal class:\n```ruby\nclass Point\n  attr_accessor :x, :y\n  def initialize(x, y)\n    @x = x\n    @y = y\n  end\nend\n```\n\nUsing Struct can do the same thing in 1 line!",
